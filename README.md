# Summer-of-Computational-Imaging
**Summer of Computational Imaging** is a 3-day high school level summer course that teaches *basic Python*, *simple Linear Algebra*, *discrete convolutions* and how to *denoise images* using them.

Disclaimer: This course has not yet been tested. The course will be 3 hours a day, but the individual splits of time have not yet been figured out.

## Overview
Day 1 - Basic Python; Intro to Vectors

Day 2 - Vectors Cont., Matrices, Color, Images; Intro to Convolutions

Day 3 - Convolutions Cont., Noise, Denoising with Convolutions; Final Project


There is also a daily 30 min homework expectation.

## Slides
For each day, there are premade slides. These slides are wordheavy since they are meant to double-down as handouts for students. As such, instead of speaker notes for every slide, there will be a few notes on key points worth emphasizing. 

## Notebooks
Along with the slideshow for the day, there is also a Python notebook file. These notebooks should be imported into Google Collabs and shared with students. The notebooks give the students a chance to practice the concepts learned from the slides and can also be used as notes for later.
At the end of the notebooks are the "mini-projects"; these mini-projects are small algorithms that students are asked to build completely by themselves. Coding is best learned when you are forced to figure things out for yourself, so use these mini-projects as a way for students to do that. When answering questions from students about the mini-projects, make sure to respond with guiding questions rather than absolute answers.

## Homework
For homework (after days 1 and 2) students will be given a Google Collab notebook that is partially filled out. Their task will be to fill in the code that is specified throughout the notebook's comments. Solutions will be provided the day after. Solutions are not available on this page, so if you are a teacher for this course email this email: [placeholder] for the solution notebooks.
